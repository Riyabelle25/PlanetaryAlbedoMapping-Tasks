# GSoC'21 Evaluation Task: Planetary Albedo


## Files:

* `Machine Learning Model for the Albedo of Mercury.pdf` The Proposal I wrote and submitted with ML4SCI for GsoC'21
* `Evaluation Exercise MLMAPPER.pdf` The Problem Statements we were asked to study, analyse and submit results for
* `Evaluation_Test_MLMAPPER_.ipynb` Notebook containing my work i.e, task submisson


## Tasks Performed:
* Built a predictive model each for **Predicting the Lunar albedo** based on the chemical composition data from the
Lunar Prospector, and for **Predicting Mercurys elemental composition** from it's planetary albedo using 

* Experimented with **Regression** models and **Ensemble** methods from the `sklearn` ML toolbox and `Keras`

* Worked with the **MESSENGER Data**: carried out Data Exploration along with it's Proceessing/Cleaning, Predictive Modelling and Accuracy Metrics.

* Submitted a Proposal for review on the same with the **ML4SCI organization for Google Summer of Code'21**, and got feedback from the mentors.
