# GSoC'21 Evaluation Task: Planetary Albedo

## Tasks Performed:
• Built a predictive model each for **Predicting the Lunar albedo** based on the chemical composition data from the
Lunar Prospector, and for **Predicting Mercurys elemental composition** from it's planetary albedo using 

• Experimented with **Regression** models and ensemble methods from the **sklearn ML toolbox and Keras** 

• Worked with the **MESSENGER Data**: carried out Data Exploration along with it's Proceessing/Cleaning, Predictive Modelling and Accuracy Metrics.

• Submitted a Proposal for review on the same with the **ML4SCI organization for Google Summer of Code'21**, and got feedback from the mentors.
